PrawnVIEW

Definition

Final year project in which part of an automation project will be developed.
The final project is about receiving the raw material (in this case shrimp) separated by vibration on a tape,
and with the help of an automaton place the visible part of a box of prawns, where they must offer the final consumer
an appearance aligned and in two rows. In these moments for that task the company Gambastar S.L. has 8 people.

With PrawnView what will be developed will be the first phase, where we must visualize, locate and count the individuals.
With this we could already know the position of the individuals for their subsequent manipulation by the automaton.
